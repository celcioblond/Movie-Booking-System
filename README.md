# Movie Booking System Project

## Description
This project is a **Movie Booking System (MBS)** developed for a chain of six movie theaters
facing issues with long lines and declining ticket sales. Our solution enables users to conveniently
buy tickets online, with options to print or display them on their personal devices for easy theater access.
Key features include user registration and login, browsing and searching movie catalogs, secure ticket booking,
electronic ticket generation, and user movie reviews.
